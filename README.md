# This app allows you to check the energy that your house is using

It reads from the shelly cloud the data about your shellys so you can check how they behave, currently the app is set to work with the values that I've define for my shelly setup, as I'm reading the energy that I use and send to my energy provider, and I'm also checking the energy that I'm producing in my solar panel setup.
